# FrSkySPortTelem
Arduino Library to read information from FrSky S.Port sensors created by Pawel Spychalski.
See original blogpost on rcgroups forum here: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2245978-FrSky-S-Port-telemetry-library-easy-to-use-and-configurable

This library can either read information from S.Port sensors as a receiver would or emulate an FrSky sensor to pass data to a receiver, but it cannot do both at the same time. 
This is explained in further detail at the blogpost link mentioned previously.

# S.Port Sensor Connections
Connection diagrams are provided for Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers.
